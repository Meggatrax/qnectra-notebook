Hi [COO Name],

When we spoke in June about the GSOC Cloud Support Transformation, we outlined how IPC could shift from reactive "fire-fighting" to a proactive, white-glove model.

I understand from Connor that the VP role is on pause. My guess is that the challenges we discussed: siloed workflows, lack of unified tooling, and reactive incident management, are likely still creating risk for IPC One's growth.

Rather than wait for a full-time hire, I'd like to propose a **1-day on-site or virtual workshop**:
• Deep-dive into your current support operations
• Diagnose root causes across people, process, and tooling
• Deliver a **custom 6-month action plan**—ready to execute the next day

This will leverage my **Strategic AI-Powered Operational Excellence Framework**, which I've developed to transform support operations such as yours.

Would you be open to exploring this?

            <div class="email-content" id="email2">Subject: Re-org transitions and operational risk

Hi [COO Name],

During organizational transitions, I've seen support operations become the hidden casualty. While leadership focuses on structure and strategy, customer-facing teams often struggle with:

• Unclear escalation paths during leadership changes
• Increased manual workarounds as processes remain undefined  
• Higher stress leading to more errors and slower resolution times
• Customer frustration that compounds during uncertainty

The GSOC challenges we discussed in June—the fragmented global workflows, reactive firefighting, and tooling gaps—likely haven't improved during your re-org planning period.

This creates a perfect storm: operational strain at the exact moment when IPC One needs flawless customer experience to maintain growth momentum.

I've developed a approach specifically for organizations in transition: a rapid operational diagnostic that doesn't require full-time hiring commitments but delivers immediate stabilization and clear next steps.

The solution is a focused 1-day workshop (onsite or virtual) where we:
• Deep-dive into current global operations across people, processes, and tooling
• Diagnose root causes behind ongoing performance issues  
• Deliver a custom 6-month action plan that aligns with your re-org timeline

This gives you operational clarity and stability while you complete your organizational planning—without the complexity of a full-time hire during transition.

Worth a conversation?

            <div class="email-content" id="email3">Subject: GSOC Operational Diagnostic Workshop - Proposal

Hi [COO Name],

Given the operational challenges we discussed in June and the complexity of managing support performance during your current re-org, I wanted to share a specific proposal that could provide immediate value.

**GSOC Operational Diagnostic Workshop**

**The Challenge:** Support operations suffering during transition period while IPC One growth demands excellent customer experience.

**The Solution:** One-day intensive diagnostic (onsite or virtual) delivering:

• Current state assessment across global teams (KL, Madrid, cloud support)
• Root cause analysis of ongoing CSAT/escalation issues  
• Process gap identification in incident management and workflows
• Tooling evaluation and automation opportunities
• Custom 6-month operational improvement roadmap

**What You Get:**
✓ Immediate clarity on operational bottlenecks
✓ Prioritized action plan aligned with re-org timeline  
✓ Quick wins to stabilize performance while you complete organizational planning
✓ Framework for future full-time leadership to execute against

**Why This Approach:**
- No long-term hiring commitment during transition uncertainty
- Immediate value without disrupting re-org process
- Proven methodology from my work with 900+ customer environments
- Clear deliverables you can act on regardless of future hiring decisions

The workshop can be scheduled around your re-org timeline and deliverables provided within 48 hours of completion.

Would you like to discuss this approach? I can share more details on format, timing, and outcomes.

Best regards,

Hi [COO Name],

I know you're focused on getting the re-org right, but wanted to share one final perspective.

The operational challenges we discussed in June—the ones that were threatening IPC One's customer experience—those don't pause while organizational planning happens. They typically accelerate.

Every day with fragmented global workflows, reactive support processes, and manual bottlenecks is another day of:
• Increased customer frustration during a critical growth phase
• Team burnout that makes eventual hiring and onboarding harder
• Compounding technical debt in your support operations

The workshop I proposed isn't about adding complexity during your transition. It's about buying you operational stability and clarity so your re-org can succeed without customer experience casualties.

One day. Clear diagnosis. Six-month roadmap. No long-term commitments.

If the timing isn't right now, I understand. But if stabilizing support operations while you complete organizational planning would be valuable, let's talk.

Best regards,
Chris

P.S. The methodology I use is the same one that led to the transformation framework you saw in June—just adapted for organizations in transition.
